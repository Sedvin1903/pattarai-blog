A tiny hand-held gadget used to send urgent or vital communications over a network. We were aware of a pager's function but didn't know how it was built. Then gradually we made efforts and learned a lot about it. We intended to bring pager technology up to date since, in today's technological environment, the traditional pager is less efficient. We came up with a number of ideas and thoughts throughout the project brainstorming. We considered adopting LoRa technology at first, however it was rejected owing to the limited number of bytes that could be transmitted.

So, in the end, we opted for web sockets and used both TCP and UDP protocols to receive and transmit messages. We used the ESP 32 development board for WIFI networking in terms of hardware. We experienced various obstacles when developing the code for Server-to-Client communication, but with study, we were able to implement broadcasting to the required clients.

## We had a lot of fun working on this project because it included Software, Hardware, Electronics, Internet of Things and 3D modeling w/ Fabrication.

For Version 1, we've limited ourselves to the bare essentials in order to keep the pager looking simple and attractive.
We want to introduce TFT LCD Color panels and possibly GSM (Cellular Technology) in the future to provide a greater variety of communication options.

The main goal of this project is to establish a communication network exclusively for PATTARAI members.
