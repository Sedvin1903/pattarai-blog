‚ÄúManagement is the key to success‚Äù - the ideology of Cortex

Pattarai was started as a project club and has grown far beyond it. The ideology of Pattarai and how it works may be known to many people. But when there is a club, it needs to function effectively and efficiently and we need something that keeps the club and its members on track and elevated. That‚Äôs where the need for Project Cortex arises.

We have developed an ERP suite that can be used to automate and simplify individual activities across a business organization, such as event and project management. The main goal of our project is to create a relationship between the end-user and the organizer by streamlining workflows, boosting productivity and providing a holistic HRM for our Human Resource force.

#### Cortex comprises different sub-modules which have been exclusively built for institutions and business organizations.

We have used a modern tech stack to build fascinating components. Without a doubt, our product is extremely beneficial for all organizations in terms of HRM. At Pattarai, we have different roles and we also work on diverse projects. Cortex helps us to monitor, plan and maintain projects and provides hassle-free access to the webapp. It has an attractive user interface providing various platform offerings.

## ‚ÄúStarting over is a chance to build something better‚Äù

Constant learning and practicing will pay way to perfection.

## Cortex was such a project that had constant and challenging learning and practicing. Those obstacles and challenges were overcome by starting over and learning more which led to the success of Cortex.
