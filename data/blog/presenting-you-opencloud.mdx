# Don't just throw away your old hardware and mobile phones anymore.

Do you know where this planet’s cheapest cloud service providing platform was built? Yeah, obviously it was molded by the hands of the elite engineers here in Pattarai! Our framework makes your old PCs, mobile phones, etc into cloud servers that can scale up to loads of your software deployment needs.

# Yes, you heard us right! 80% of Pattarai's databases, web servers and other cloud services are running on a cloud that is powered by cheap old mobile phones & hardwares.

Build, run and manage applications across clouds, on-premises and at the edge, with the tools and frameworks of their choice. To run modern operating systems and apps, hardware older than 15 years was recovered from scrap, assembled, and modifications were made both on the hardware and software levels. Now, in Pattarai, we'll improve the present setup and turn it into a market product that's scalable, as well as construct a web application that includes all of the capabilities of our open cloud project and make it market-ready.

I along with my team developed a solution, right from the scratch both the server-side and the software side.

We had roller coaster experience level fun during the learning phase for this project. We as a team learnt the techstack required for this project alongside working hands-on in the project. We gained the crystal clear knowledge on the micro architecture and cloud computing in the vital way by our Veteran and Founder of the club, Mr. Pon Rahul. We didn't shrink our borders only to us for learning, it was open to all to get themselves enlightened with our learnzeit sessions.

Speaking on my experience in this project, I learnt front end web development along with few automation. The team spirit was so high between the team which was reflected during the prototyping and doubt solving sessions. The quick learning habit in the team led to this achieving this zenith of completing the phase 1 of Pattarai’s Open cloud in a few span of months. I, as a member of the project, loved the vibe between us and became close buddies.

# We had a dream, we designed it, we developed it!
