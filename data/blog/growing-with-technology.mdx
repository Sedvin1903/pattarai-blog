In all of the innovations and developments that have happened in the world today, there is one thing that has impressed me a lot. Robotics is one of the notable technologies whose matured evolution into the modern era can never be paralleled. Robots have revolutionized the world in a drastic way which still makes me wonder what is going to happen next.

It all started with an intent to automate a few tasks and unman repeated chores that do not require hired hands. Apart from a sturdy mechanical design, actuators with the help of sensors help it to discern our world, learn and adapt to live in the world by performing the commands taught to it.The actuators play a pivotal role in controlling a robot.

From the locomotion of robot arms to accelerators and steering in self-driving cars, there is a vast number of diverse applications. Moreover, there are a large number of sensors that support us in obtaining information from our surroundings. On top of that, several algorithms are being constructed to help us discard unnecessary data and explicate useful information only.

Even though the growth of robots is mesmerizing, humans have surpassed robots in many ways. We have the ability to adapt and grasp things at a faster pace. Artificial intelligence has advanced extensively in the present day and equipping them to take percipient actions depending on the situation.

I am delighted that Pattarai has grown remarkably over the years. Iâ€™m inspired by their discipline and perseverance in making things happen. Pattarai as a team is enthusiastic and zealous and itâ€™s just a matter of time before they work on booming technologies like cutting-edge technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and many more. Wishing them loads of success!
